added "config.new_page_parts = true" to pages.rb in the refinery
initializers folder. this allows a new section to be created within
pages. Don't know if this will be necessary or not for this project, but
useful to know!

useful railscast:http://railscasts.com/episodes/332-refinery-cms-basics?view=comments

rake refinery:override view=refinery/...  (_heaader, _footer, _menu, etc)
rake refinery:override view=refinery/layouts/application
rake refinery:override view=refinery/_content_page
to start "theming"

Weird issue with original home page not populatingcorrectly, so strange css classes kept coming up. Should have changed after overriding Show.html.erb, but didn't. Works fine on newly created pages.

Next, change the home page!!

Did it!

Also, wanted to make the logo stick on the side, sort of like the twitter bootstrap responsive page. Finally got it to work using the following:
<%= link_to image_tag("blue_door_logo.png"), refinery.root_path %>
the image being the first bit, and the link to the refinery root path the second (duh). It's not "sticky" (fixed) but I think will look cool as should take up the top part of the screen on a mobile. 

Shall I try pushing to Heroku?
